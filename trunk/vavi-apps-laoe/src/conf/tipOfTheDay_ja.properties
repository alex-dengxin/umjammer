numberOfTips = 102

tip0 		= ... to <b>open and play</b> an audioclip, choose the button [open] in the mainframe, and select the choosen audiofile. now the clip occurs in a new window. then choose the button [play loop rec]. now the plugin for playing the audioclips appears.  click on [play].
tip1 		= ...the frame with the name "LAoE", which appears after LAoE was launched, is the LAoE <b>mainframe</b>. This is the starting point to open audioclips and to start the most common tools to manipulate audio data, effects, zoom, play, record... etc. Only an incomplete list of plugins may be found here, the complete list of plugins is exclusively reachable through the popup-menu of the clips.
tip2 		= ...the <b>size of the clipframes</b> can be modified by mouse. The sampleplot resizes too. The default clipframe size is customizable in [file] [LAoE options].
tip3 		= ...genral settings, like fonts, language, auto-close plugins, default clipframe size... etc. is editable in the <b>LAoE options</b>. All settings will be active on the next start of LAoE. These options are reachable through [file] [LAoE options].
tip4 		= ...the whole functionality of LAoE is controlled from the <b>popup menu of the clips</b> (right mouse click). Only a small subset of the functionality is reachable through the mainframe.
tip5 		= ...the <b>zoom</b> plugin has many view-features. Offset, range and mode of x- and y-axis are editable in numeric manner. Zooming, autoscaling, moving the view is also possible by mouse and [Ctrl] and [Shift] keys. Mouse-drag moves the view, mouse-drag and pressed [Ctrl] key zooms in the vertical axis, mouse-drag and pressed [Shift] key zooms in the horizontal axis. If both keys are pressed, the zooming in is performed on both axis. Mouse-click zoomes out in function of both keys, mouse-doubleclick autoscales in function of both keys. Different autoscale-modes are possible, e.g. scaling to whole clip, to selection... etc. When [y individual] is active, each layer autoscales independently in vertical axis.
tip6 		= ...most of the <b>numeric fields</b> allow changing the unit. Just click the unit-button located on the left side to swap the unit. Most of the units like %, s, ms, dB don't need further explanation. But there are two frequency units, Hz and fdHz. Hz is used in time-domain (1/period) and fdHz is used in frequency-domain clips (spectrums), where the frequency-range is implicitely 0Hz to samplerate/2.
tip7 		= ...most of the <b>numeric spinner</b> propose tree kind of manipulation: <ul><li>clicking the up/down buttons <li>using the keyboard [arrow up], [arrow down] for small steps, [page up], [page down] for big steps <li>mouse-dragging starting inside the circle arrow on the right side of the numeric entry. You may drag out of it, drag clockwise around it to increment the numeric value, and counter-clockwise to decrement the numeric value. Fast dragging increments in big steps, slow dragging increments in small steps</ul>
tip8 		= ...the <b>undo-stack</b> allows to retrace the editing steps, come back to any previous step. It is only limited by harddisc capacity. Selection-manipulations are also stored in the undo-stack. By the way, it is possible to add manually a storage step. This stack is visualized globally, so it is easier to keep the overview than with simple [undo] and [redo] (they are supported too). Simply click on the line you want to go back or forward.
tip9 		= ... each single sample of a channel can be modified numerically with the help of the <b>sample editor</b> plugin. Since the table does not contain the whole channel at once, the offset is choosable freely or with the help of predefined settings. The channel is selectable with the help of the [channel stack] plugin.

tip10 	= ...LAoE <b>font size</b> can be changed in LAoE options. Do not use extreme values, the GUI is not very flexible, the words may be cut if the size is too large.
tip11 	= ...the <b>samplerate</b> may be changed on the fly, when playing a clip with [play loop rec] plugin. It is not limited by a couple of standard values, like 8000, 11025, 16000, 22050, 44100. Any value is possible in the range of 1000 to 48000. play- and capture-blocksize is configurable. This helps to optimize the CPU-load versus responsibility of the graphical play-pointer.  
tip12 	= ...LAoE doesn't support any <b> mixer-functionality</b> like volume, input line selection... etc. Please use the standard mixer of your operating system or any other mixer.
tip13		= ...LAoE has its own <b>calculator</b> which supports the most comon mathematical operations. In addition, there are special audio-related operations like jump octave, jump halftone, typically used on resampling (e.g. rise the pitch of two halftones).
tip14		= ... most of the <b>numeric input/output fields</b> allow data exchange through copy/paste with the OS using ctrl-c and ctrl-v shortcuts. e.g. data may be copied to the calculator, to modify them, and copy back to the input-field.
tip15		= ...the <b>select tools</b> allows the user to select ranges of a clip. No selection in a layer means whole layer selected. Most of the plugins modify samples inside a selection only. It's possible to define a selection numerically or by mouse. When using the mouse, snap to zero-cross option is possible. Each layer has its own selection, only the selection of the actual layer is visible. Mouse-drag creates a new selection, the borders of a selection may be retouched later. Mouse-drag and pressed [Shift] key creates a deep selection through all layers. Mouse-click disable the selection in the channel, mouse-doubleclick selects the area difined by markers, mouse-tripleclick selects the whole channel, mouse-quadrupleclick selects the whole layer.
tip16		= ...the <b>select expander</b> plugin allows to expand/reduce the current selection precisely to noise/silence. This helps selecting a noise/silence only, without the need of manipulating the mouse very precisely.
tip17		= ...the two <b>numbers printed on the selection</b> shows offset and length of that selection. The unit is changeable in the [view-options] plugin.
tip18		= ...when using the mouse, it is possible to generate <b>selection of multiple neighbour channels</b> by just dragging the mouse down from one channel to the next.
tip19		= ...the <b>crop</b> plugin accessible through [edit] [crop] allows to cut automatically the silent parts of the two ends of the selection. Optionally all silence parts may be cut, or simply the non-selected parts may be cut.

tip20		= ...<b>copy and paste</b> works with the selections. All selected ranges are copied. These copies may be pasted in three different ways: <ul><li>paste-insert: the content of the clipboard is inserted at the beginning of the current selection, and the selected samples are preserved, no samples get lost</li><li>paste-replace: the samples of the current selection are cut away, and the content of the clipboard replaces them</li><li>paste-into-new: a new clip is generated, the content of the clipboard is placed into this new clip</li></ul>  
tip21		= ...the <b>insert silence</b> accessible through [edit] [insert silence] allows to insert silent samples at any place. The silence is added at the begin of the selections.
tip22		= ...the selections of a channel may be <b>stored</b> momentanly, to use the same selection later again. This is possible with the menu [select] [copy selection] and [select] [paste selection]. The concerned channel is selectable in the channel stack.
tip23		= ...a <b>clip</b> contains one or more layers, a layer contains one or more channels, a channel contains the audiosamples. The layers may be edited in the [layer stack], the channels of one layer may be edited in the [channel stack]. The samples of the channels may be edited in a classic way with selections and plugins.
tip24		= ...layers may be moved, copied, deleted, newed and merged with the <b>layer-stack</b>. The same is possible with channels in the channel-stack.
tip25		= ...if a clip contains more than one layer, it is possible to <b>zoom individually</b> the vertical axis by [y individual]. In horizontal axis only common zoom is possible.
tip26		= ...the <b>measure</b> plugin contains two cursors, to measure the samples by mouse, in differential and absolute manner. These cursors may be used in three modes: <ul><li>free - cursors move everywhere</li><li>locked - cursor do not quit the sample-curve</li><li>peak - if the mouse is above the curve, then it snaps to the nearest highest point, if the mouse is below the curve, then it snaps to the nearest lowest point</li></ul> Additionally some statistical values may be measured, these are based on the actual selections.
tip27		= ...the <b>spectrum</b> plugin allows to generate a spectrum analysis using different windowing-functions. First click [new] button in the plugin, to create a new spectrum clip. Then focus the clip to analyse, where only the selected part will be analyzed. Then generate the spectrum clicking on [update]. If no spectrum is visible, don't panic, just autoscale the spectrum clip. The great thing is, this spectrum clip has the same editing- and analysis-possibilities as any other clip, think of measure-cursors, zoom, convert to dB, divide by another spectrum to get the transfer-function... etc. You may even save this spectrum.
tip28		= ...the <b>signal generator</b> plugin is able to generate divers signals: constant signals (e.g. constant amplitude, ramp), periodic signals (e.g. sinus, triangle, rectangle), noise signals (e.g. white noise, gaussian noise) and transient signals (e.g. gaussian distribution). Most of these signals can be added to the actual signal, in addition to replacing the actual samples.
tip29		= ...the <b>free generator</b> plugin allows to draw samplecurve by hand, as with a pen. Divers interpolations are selectable: <ul><li>spline, first order - linear segments </li><li>zeroth order - horizontal lines stair </li><li>single points - dirac peaks, and the rest unchanged </li><li>freehand - no interpolation</li></ul> All curves are editable: the points may be moved by mouse, new points may be inserted (mouse-click), points may be locked on the actual sample-curve (mouse-drag and pressed [ctrl]) and points may be deleted (mouse-click and pressed [Shift] key). Once the curve is ready, it may be written to the channel using [apply], or used as envelope-curve where the neutral value (1) is situated at the top and zero at the x-axis. Each channel has its own curve. The curves may only affect selected part of the channel, or they may be [selection-independent]. Some manipulations like [reset], [copy] and [paste] are applied to the selected channel (in the [channel stack]) only.

tip30		= ...the <b>harmonics generator</b> plugin allows to create superposed sinus-signals. You only have to give the base frequency and a list of harmonics amplitude values.
tip31		= ...the <b>pitch generator</b> plugin allows to loop with constant or variable pitch through a basis signal. The base signal is created with [new], and the result is written to the focussed clip inside the selection. The base signal may be of any length.
tip32		= ...there are two <b>types of layers</b>: <ul><li>audio layer - normal audible layer is painted fully</li><li>parameter layer - this layer is not audible and is typically used for variable parameters of plugins and only the borders are painted</li></ul>
tip33		= ...the <b>amplify</b> plugin allows to change the amplitude of the selected samples in constant or variable (envelopping) manner. Any curve is allowed when variable amplification is performed. The neutral value of the variable parameter is 1. Additional features are removing DC (approximately below 5 Hz), different normalisation modes (depending on bitwidth), saturate (depending on bitwidth) and inverting (negative amplification). The normalisation is possible in channel-independent mode or in coupled mode to preserve left-right pan.
tip34		= ...the <b>pan</b> plugin allows to adjust the pan (left/right) of a two-channel-clip. In opposite to most of the plugins using variable parameters where a layer is used as parameter, here only a channel is used as parameter. The parameter has following value range: <ul><li>1 only first channel</li><li>1.5 both channels</li><li>2 only second channel</li><li>and all intermediate values</li></ul> Different mixing modes are possible, different left/right-shapes are possible.
tip35		= ...the <b>fade</b> plugin allows to fade a selection in linear, square, cubic, square-root manner. In addition to the fade in, fade out, there is a fade-cross, where the selection will be reduced to the half-length, and the first half of the samples will fade out and the second half will be fade in, superposing both ends. The [continue low] continues to attenuate all samples after fade out and all samples before fade in.
tip36		= ...in the <b>compress expand</b> plugin the transfer function is entered in the table below. Two columns "factor" and "amplitude" and three rows are usable. Each row holds the information "use this factor until this amplitude!". If you don't need three segments, use enough big amplitudes in the rows above, so that they will never reach by the actual samples. In the "f(amplitude)" mode, the transfer-function is given by a layer, where x is the input value, and y the output value. Ok, this is limited because the x-value cannot be applied to very large 32bit-values, but it works fine for 16bit and lower values. You may create a neutral curve with the signal generator using the normalized ramp generator. Attack and release values controls the dynamic domain of compressing.
tip37		= ...the <b>distortion</b> plugin allows to perform simple distortion (e.g. clamping and noise gate) and distortion with a free transfer function curve. The required units of the curve: horizontal 1, vertical 1. You may create a neutral curve with the signal generator using the normalized ramp generator.
tip38		= ...the <b>auto volume</b> plugin allows to keep a constant volume over time, that means the quiet parts are amplified and the loud parts are reduced. It is not easy to find the best attack and release parameters, try it out. If the volume-correction-delay is not acceptable, try the [backward] mode: here the processing is performed from right to left. The sound is a little different.
tip39		= ...the <b>resample</b> plugin allows to resample the selected samples. Different resampling methods are supported: constant resampling, linear (sweep) resampling and variable resampling with a parameter curve f(time). The resampling is given by a factor, where the value 1 is neutral, a higher value means faster, a lower value means slower, to give a so-called doppler-effect. Do not use the value 0, it is an extrema. Keep in range of 1/10 .. 10. Different interpolations may be used, but the best quality is always 3rd order, use it.

tip40		= ...the <b>math</b> plugin allows to perform mathematical operations and convertions on selected samples. constant operations like multiplication with a constant, addition, inverting, square, integral... etc. Variable operations with a variable operand curve like multiplication with parameter curve, addition...etc. <br><br> Examples: to find out locations of clicks, just perform derivate operation (maybe multiple times), peaks will appear there. If you want to see the spectrum in dB, perform the [to dB] conversion on the spectrum-curve. If you want to get the transfer-function of a filter, divise the output-spectrum through the input-spectrum of that filter.
tip41		= ...the <b>convolution</b> plugin allows to perform a time domain convolution. The kernel is editable in form of a list or from a parameter curve (don't use too long kernels because of performance reasons - think of DSP theory, make multiplication with kernel in frequency domain instead).
tip42		= ...the <b>FFT</b> plugin allows to perform a Fast Fourier Transformation (and inverse transformation). The time domain signal of the actual layer is transformed to frequency domain magnitude, and a new layer is created with frequency domain phase (unit in radiants). On IFFT, the magnitude must be in the actual layer, and the phase must be specified explicitely. It is a complicated handling, because the frequency domain needs two separate layers for magnitude and phase, but this makes LAoE able to edit a clip in frequency domain! Imagine custom filtering, pitch-shifting, harmony-editing... and then transform back to time-domain. Did you ever had this freedom?
tip43		= ...the <b>reverse</b> plugin allows to reverse in time selected samples. There are different reverse-modes: <ul><li>[mirror right side] - the right end of the selection is the mirror axis, and on the right a mirrored selection is inserted</li><li>[mirror left side] - the left end of the selection is the mirror axis, and on the left a mirrored selection is inserted</li><li>[itself] - the selection is time-reversed</li></ul>
tip44		= ...the <b>loopable</b> plugin optimizes a selection for loop-mode. In [crossfade] mode both non-selected ends are crossfaded, to avoid disturbing clicks. The shape of fading is choosable. The [canon] mode folds the selection, like a canon-song. The number of folding is choosable. In [keep size] mode the left and right borders (inside selection) are faded. The [multiplicate] mode duplicates the selected part n times.
tip45		= ...the <b>flip bytes</b> plugin allows to change freely the order of the bytes in the sample-format (little endian, big endian), e.g. to rescue samples from a wrong written soundfile. The transformation is defined in integer-range only, so only integer-part is taken into account.
tip46		= ...the <b>equalizer</b> plugin allows to change simply a spectrum of selected samples. The number of bands is configurable. The higher the number of bands, the narrower the spectrum of one single band. Some presets may be used. To get a stronger filtering, just increase the order of equalisation. [invert] inverts the shape of equalizer-band settings.
tip47		= ...the <b>parameter filter</b> plugin allows to perform standard low pass, high pass and band pass with adaptable parameters. These filters are of first order.
tip48		= ...the <b>multi-notch</b> plugin allows to stop several frequency components. An example, power noise: the power supply has a frequency of 50Hz (Europe), the noise has some harmonics, multiple of 50Hz. To filter the power noise, the multi-notch filter is set to 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300 and 350Hz. The [quality] may be set to 7..10, to have narrow stop-bands. After filtering, the power noise is almost away, but the signal keeps its whole frequency range. Observe the spectrum before and after to understand this filter.
tip49		= ...the <b>FFT-Filter</b> plugin works like the spectrum plugin: create a new spectrum with [new], which may be edited with all possible tools. [flat] allows to generate a neutral transfer-function. Then focus on the clip to be filtered, and select the range to be filtered. Perform the FFT-filtering with [apply]. Some predefined sharp spectrums like sharp lowpass, highpass, bandpass and bandstop may be generated automatically. The FFT-filter works blockwise, to be able to perform big clips. The transfer-function or spectrum may be saved as any other audioclip.

tip50		= ...the <b>reverb</b> plugin allows to perform different reverb-types: the most simple ones are comb and allpass, which make part of base functionality, but these sounds a little too metallic. The multi-reverb sounds more natural, because internally several parallel reverbs are applied. This is performed with the help of the shape-table, which contains relative values, delay and gain are factors of the general delay and gain defined above. Some shape-presets are available. There is also the [curve] reverb, where the room is defined in form of a clip, the horizontal axis is the delay axis, the vertical axis is the feedback-amplitude axis. The rooms may be saved as any other clip.
tip51		= ...the <b>delay echo</b> plugin allows to perform simple echo effects, it is multi-echo capable by editing the shape-table. This shape-table contains relative values, delay and gain are factors of the general delay and gain defined above. Like the reverb-plugin, a parameter-layer may be used as room-definition.
tip52		= ...the <b>chorus flange</b> plugin allows to perform classical chorus and flange effects. These are parametrisable, and maybe a little complicated to use. Some presets should help to find requested effect and values. The effect varies very strong depending the range of parameters used. Typically use the sinus shape, the other shapes can be used to experience. The saw-shape makes a simple pitch-shifting effect!
tip53		= ...the <b>vibrato</b> plugin generates a vibrating pitch effect with choosable amplitude and frequency of vibration.
tip54		= ...the factor of the <b>pitch shift / time stretch</b> plugin should be in range of 1/3 .. 3, because outside the quality decreases very fast. Adapt the buffer length and transition to optimize quality. Musical units exists for factor-setting, like halftone, octave. Variable pitch-shift is also supported.  
tip55		= ...the <b>multi-pitch</b> plugin allows to take an original sound and add several voices to it. Halftone-factors may be taken from calculator.
tip56		= ...the <b>disharmony</b> plugin allows to completely disharmony a clip, this generates strange athmospheres. Different modes exists: there is just one rule, try and try again. The [disharmony] factor may be choosen from -1 to 1, try very small ranges too (<0.05). Big buffer lengths gives better results. The best result is given on harmonic clips like music.
tip57		= ...the <b>narrow wide</b> plugin allows to a stereo clip (two-channel-clip) to narrow it to mono or to widen it to stereo. In the [constant] mode the narrow/wide factor is applied uniformely in time. The [f(time)] mode allows to vary progressively from mono to stereo with a parameter curve. Value-range of the parameter: 0 narrowest (mono), 1 unchanged, 2 widest. Modification may be enabled/disabled separately on both channels. Linear variation of narrow-wide is selectable in the [sweep] mode.
tip58		= ...in the <b>noise reduction</b> plugin only click-reduction is implemented at the time. [sense] allows to decide from which slope on it is considered to be a click. [smooth] defines the intensity of click-smoothening.
tip59		= ...the <b>clip properties</b> plugin allows to modify general clip values like samplerate and samplewidth (in bits). Format and comment are editable here.

tip60		= ...<b>external plugins</b> may be added any time to the current LAoE-version. See the manual for proceeding.
tip61		= ...sample-cutpoints, which occurs when paste, cut and other editing functions, are automatically smoothed with the <b>zero-cross</b> algorithm, to avoid disturbing clicks. These zero-cross can be configured in the select-plugin.
tip62		= ...<b>default comments</b> may be modified in the LAoE-options. At the time, only the .laoe-format supports the use of comments.
tip63		= ...LAoE is multi-language capable, the <b>language</b> may be set in the LAoE-options. Each language must have its own "language_xx.properties" file, where xx stands for the language abbreviation: de deutsch, en english, fr français... At the time only german and english is supported, but LAoE is extensible to any language. You may create your own language-file, copy the english file and translate the words on right side of "=".
tip64		= ...the <b>undo stack</b> can be optionally compressed, to save harddisk space. But this decreases very strongly the speed of LAoE, because compression must be performed at any working step. It is better not to compress. <br><br> If LAoE is really too slow on your computer, disable the undo-stack. But this is only to consider as last issue.
tip65		= ...there are many plugin-frames which will fill the screen very quickly. To avoid this overpopulation, LAoE allows to <b>auto-close</b> the plugins with a time-scheduler. The more visible plugin-frames on the screen, the faster the closing-rate. A minimum of 4 frames remains. The auto-closecan be enabled/disabled in the LAoE-options.
tip66		= ...the <b>loop points</b> can be moved freely on the clip, these are visible as vertical red lines. They may be moved by mouse or in predefined manner when focussing the [play-loop-rec] plugin.
tip67		= ...the <b>recording</b> doesn't work correctly yet!!! Try a 8bit, 44100 samplerate, mono-channel, you may have best chances with this format on linux. But no guarantee. This is mostly due to the bad java virtual machine implementation...
tip68		= ...there is a shortcut method to start plugins by making <b>mouse-drawings</b>. this speed-ups working. after clicking the middle mouse-button inside a clipframe, a red border appears. now you can draw a symbol by dragging the middle mouse-button in on stroke. on release, if LAoE recognizes the symbol, the concerned plugin is started. following symbols are supported: <table border="1"><tr><td>symbol </td><td>draw sequence description: <b>u</b>p, <b>d</b>own, <b>l</b>eft, <b>r</b>ight</td><td> plugin to start </td></tr><tr><td>C </td><td>l-d-r</td><td> copy </td></tr><tr><td>C</td><td>l-u-r</td><td> cut </td></tr><tr><td> d </td><td>d-l-u-r</td><td>duplicate</td></tr><tr><td>I</td><td>d</td><td>measure</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>r</td><td>select</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>l</td><td>unselect layer</td></tr><tr><td>I</td><td>u</td><td>zoom</td></tr><tr><td>L </td><td>d-r</td><td>play loop rec</td></tr><tr><td>P</td><td>u-r-d-l</td><td>paste</td></tr><td>S</td><td>l-d-r-d-l</td><td>save</td></tr><td>mirrored S</td><td>r-d-l-d-r</td><td>tip of the day</td></tr><td>S</td><td>r-u-l-u-r</td><td>spectrum</td></tr><td>n</td><td>u-r-d</td><td>new</td></tr><td>n</td><td>u-l-d</td><td>amplify</td></tr><td>U</td><td>d-r-u</td><td>undo-stack</td></tr><td>F</td><td>u-r</td><td>free generator</td></tr><td>F</td><td>l-d</td><td>fade</td></tr></tr><td>mirrored F</td><td>r-d</td><td>equalizer</td></tr></table>
tip69		= ...when starting LAoE in a shell, <b>general information</b> is printed, like LAoE version, language, current operating system and java JRE version.

tip70		= ...RMS and other moving average curves can be generated using [RMS] or [mean] operation in the <b>math</b> plugin. Operand 1 is the weight of previous values compared to the new value.
tip71		= ...the <b>system info</b> plugin shows information about... <ul><li>the audio features of your computer usable by LAoE <li>the memory management of LAoE </ul>
tip72		= ...the <b>find</b> plugin helps to find samples or range of samples with different find-criteria: minimum sample, maximum sample, previous/next silence or noisy parts... etc. The result is given in form of selections.
tip73		= ...the <b>VU-meter</b> indicates current amplitude of played clip, in dB-scale.
tip74		= ...if you want to introduce an effect progressively in a range with smooth borders, so use <b>intensity</b> within selections. Select the intensity-tab in the select-frame, now you can edit the intensity. Intensity is visualized as a segmented yellow line inside a selection. The initial setting of intensity is 100% over the whole selection range, visualized as a top horizontal line. Points may be add on mouse-click, points may be removed on mouse-clicking with pressed [shift]-key. intensity of 100% is located at the top of selection, intensity of 0% is located at the bottom of selection. Any intermediate intensity is possible, any number of segments may be added to a intensity-curve. Even the scale is modifiable. Now when applying an effect to this selection, the effect is mixed with the original part in function of the intensity-curve.
tip75		= ...<b>Work with layers!</b> You want to perform effects on parts of sound only, you want to vary volume individually, you want to perform effects with variable parameters in time, you want to keep sound separatly for future use or flexibility... so use layers!
tip76		= ...every channel has its own <b>mask</b>. The mask is an editable black segmented line which allows to reduce the amplitude of a channel in function of time, as an envelope curve, without touching the original samples. The mask is taken into account when playing the clip, and when merging channels and layers. Top of channel is 100%, bottom is 0%. Masks are editable with the mouse. [complementary] allows to invert the mask, loud parts become quiet, and quiet parts become loud. [apply definitely] applies the attenuation of the mask to the samples, so the mask is eliminated, and the samples definitely modified. Some actions are applied to the selected channel only (see [channel stack]).
tip77		= ...<b>unmask layer</b> removes all masks of the actual layer. No mask means no volume reduction in function of time, use of neutral factor 1.
tip78		= ...<b>select before</b> and <b>select after</b> considers the actual selection, selects the range before/after the actual selection, and after that removes actual selection.
tip79		= ...the <b>plugin-history</b> shows the list of last used plugins, and when clicking on a plugin in the list, it is started again. This is helpful, if you use the same plugins again and again, and so you don't need to navigate through the deep menu-structure.

tip80		= ...in addition to the classical sample-curve-view a layer can be shown in <b>spectrogram-view</b>, choosable in the [layer-stack] plugin. In this mode, the x-axis represents the time, the y-axis represents the frequency, and the color-intensity represents the magnitude. The different sound-components or harmonics are visible separately in 2D, this would not be possible in the sample-curve-view.
tip81		= ...spectrogram parameters like FFT-length and windowing may be changed in the <b>view options</b>.
tip82		= ...the <b>spectrogram-filter</b> allows to select time-frequency ranges, with help of a pen that draws rectangles or a rectangle-brushed line. These selected ranges are then magnified or reduced with the help of the spectrogram-filter. Some of the actions are applied to the selected channel only. <p>Example: filter out unwanted sound-part, like disturbing voice or parasit sound.
tip83		= ...the <b>about</b> frame shows version and  other general informations. In addition, when this frame is focussed, a sound should play. This is a simple test to find out if LAoE sound works. <br><br> (It's Sarah, my little daugther)
tip84		= ...to <b>move a selection</b>, start the [move] plugin, press the [ctrl] key before dragging with the mouse
tip85		= ...you will find information about <b>clipped samples</b> in the measure-plugin and you may find them with the find-plugin.
tip86		= ...you can change the <b>unit</b> of the selections and x- and y-scale in the [view options] plugin.
tip87		= ...the <b>additional graphical objects</b> like segment-curves, cursors, lines etc. are only painted on the clip if the corresponding plugin is active (visible frame).
tip88		= ...the <b>color of the layer</b> is choosable in the layer-stack.
tip89		= ...if you need <b>perfect sharp-edged filters</b> like lowpass, highpass, bandpass or band-stop, use the FFT-filter and generate the shapes of these filters automatically with the help of the parameters in the filter-tabs.

tip90		= ...a <b>histogram</b> view may be generated with the histogram-plugin. The x-axis represents the amplitude, the y-axis the number of samples which corresponds to that amplitude. This view gives typically information of how the clip has been compressed, since "natural" sound consists of a histogram with exponentially decreasing distribution.
tip91		= ...the file "trace.txt" contains <b>runtime informations</b> for developers, when a technical problem occurs. If you want to see these informations in realtime, you have to start LAoE with the following comand line: <br>laoe -d 6,shell
tip92		= ...how to use <b>layer stack and channel stack</b>. when editing, keep in mind that you edit the selected layer only, and some plugins apply their actions on the selected channel (of the selected layer) only.
tip93		= ...<b>markers</b> may help to divide a soundclip in different sections. To edit markers, the markers-tab of the [select] plugin must be active. Insert new markers with mouse-click, remove markers with mouse-click and pressed [shift]-key, move markers with mouse-drag. Copy and paste markers from/to different channels with the help of the [channel stack]. Place two markers at the current selection-begin and -end using [from selection]. The only way to use markers is to make a selection with the mouse-doubleclick.
tip94		= ...if you have records that contain clipped samples because of too loud recording, then you can remove them automatically with the help of the <b>clipp removing</b> mode in the [noise reduction] plugin. You may limit the maximum width of clipped parts that LAoE should consider, and the minimum relative amplitude-step that should be recognized as clipped transition.
tip95		= ...when playing a clip, some <b>key shortcuts</b> may be used to control playback and to define markers in realtime: <ul><li>[p] play</li><li>[t] stop</li><li>[space] pause/continue</li><li>[left] rewind</li><li>[right] forwind</li><li>[s] set loop startpoint</li><li>[e] set loop endpoint</li><li>[m] insert marker</li></ul>
tip96		= ...the function <b>remove mono</b> in the [narrow wide] plugin removes the mono-part of a stereo-clip. The result is a mono-clip. If the mono-source is not exactly centered (left - right), the [pan] setting may help to remove excentric mono-parts of a clip. <p>This function is typically used to eliminate voice from a song. It doesn't work on stereo-voices. But most of the stereo-recorded songs have voice recorded in mono. That's why this function works.
tip97		= ...<b>documentation, manuals and tutorials</b> are available at the official homepage of LAoE, at www.oli4.ch/laoe. 
tip98		= ...LAoE is <b> multiuser capable </b>. The user-settings, location of the plugins, history... etc. are stored for each user independently. LAoE creates a .laoe directory in the user home directory for this reason. To remove all user-settings (e.g. in case of problems), just delete this directory. On next start of LAoE, the installation of the user-settings is proposed again. 
tip99		= ...the current view of a soundclip may be stored as an <b>image file</b>, in .jpeg or .png format. You may optionally draw the plugin-drawings selectable by popup-dialog. The numeric ruler are drawed only if enabled in the view-options plugin. 

tip100		= ...the <b>graphic doc</b> plugin allows to draw lines, rectangles, text... etc. onto the sample clip, which has only documentation purposes. The drawings do not affect any audio data. For example, draw an arrow which points to a location, where samples have been changed. Add a text there, which explains the changes or audio-processing that have been made. The drawings are stored in the .laoe format only. 
tip101		= ...the <b>split to new</b> plugin considers the markers, and split a clip into multiple new clips, each part is defined from marker to marker.
